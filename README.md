# SD140-CourseProject
##Summary:
This website was created as part of the Mobile Application Development class at Rasmussen College in 2018. I was tasked to create a web
application that displays a list of favorites that originally contained three pages. As the course continued, more prompts were given
and the website was expanded on over the course of the 6 week class. This website was designed around the concept of a list website, 
similar to what can be seen with listverse, or ranker, but on a much more basic level. The web application could allow users to browse
popular lists on the website which a later rating system could be implemented to have users vote on their favorite list.
